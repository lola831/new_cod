                We offer guided fishing tours in the Monterey Bay, catering to both recreational and experienced anglers. Our trips focus on West Coast ground fish species such as rockfish, 
                lingcod, and halibut. We also offer seasonal trips targeting bluefin tuna during late summer and early fall. We also offer whale watching tours, at sea burials, and are a general 
                boat for hire for scientific research.</li>
